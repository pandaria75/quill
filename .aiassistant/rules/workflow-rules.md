# Workflow Rules

Use rule metadata from `00-repository-rules.md` when workflow constraints are provisional, verified, future-state, or strictly enforceable.

## Marionettist Gates

- Rule: For non-trivial tasks, do not move from analysis to coding or between approved coding slices or approved parallel groups without explicit user confirmation, unless the selected gate policy explicitly allows continuation for the next already-approved `gateClass: simple` slice and that slice's supplemental `risk_score` does not require a stronger pause. Review for the current approved slice or group may still start automatically after coding.
  - type: hard
  - confidence: high
  - source: repository workflow policy

## Context Pack

- Rule: For Tier M and Tier L tasks, create or update `.task/<task-id>/context-pack.md` before coding. Read `<task-id>` from `.task/active.json`.
  - type: confirmed
  - confidence: high
  - source: repository workflow policy

Legacy `.task/context-pack.md` may be used only as a migration fallback and must not be the default output path for new tasks.

## Documentation

- Rule: Update project knowledge only when design, architecture, functional behavior, workflow, or boundary rules change.
  - type: confirmed
  - confidence: high
  - source: repository workflow policy

Do not update docs only because implementation files were added, renamed, or reorganized unless the design meaning changed.

## Interpretation Reminder

- Workflow rules marked `observed` describe how the project currently appears to operate; they are evidence, not default blockers.
- Workflow rules marked `target` describe desired future process and should not be reported as current mandatory behavior unless the approved work is implementing them.
